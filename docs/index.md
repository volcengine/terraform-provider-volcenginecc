# Volcengine Cloud Control Provider

The Volcengine Cloud Control Provider enables interaction with various Volcengine-supported resources through the Cloud Control API. Prior to usage, you must configure the provider with appropriate credentials.

Use the left navigation panel to explore available resource documentation. If you cannot find the desired resource, please submit an issue report for assistance.

> **NOTE**ï¼š
> 1. The Volcengine Cloud Control provider requires the use of Terraform 1.0.7 or later.
> 2. This guide requires an available Volcengine account or sub-account to create resources.

## Example Usage

Terraform 1.0.7 and later:

```shell
# Configure the Volcenginecc Provider
terraform {
  required_providers {
    volcenginecc = {
      source  = "volcengine/volcenginecc"
      version = "~> 0.0.1"
    }
  }
}

# Create VPC
resource "volcenginecc_vpc_vpc" "VPCDemo" {
  vpc_name = "vpc-demo"
  description = "VpcDemo Example"
  cidr_block = "192.168.0.0/24"
  support_ipv_4_gateway = true
  enable_ipv_6 = false
  project_name = "default"
  tags = [
    {
      key = "env"
      value = "test"
    }
  ]
}

# Query VPC
data "volcenginecc_vpc_vpc" "VpcVpcDataSource" {
  id = volcenginecc_vpc_vpc.VPCDemo.id
}
```

## Authentication

The Volcenginecc provider offers a flexible means of providing credentials for authentication. The following methods are supported, in this order, and explained below:

### Static credentials

Static credentials can be provided by adding an public_key and private_key in-line in the volcengine provider block:

> **Warning**:
> Hard-coded credentials are not recommended in any Terraform configuration and risks secret leakage should this file ever be committed to a public version control system.

Usage:

```shell
provider "volcenginecc" {
   access_key = "your ak"
   secret_key = "your sk"
   region = "cn-beijing"
}
```

### Environment variables

You can provide your credentials via VOLCENGINE_ACCESS_KEY and VOLCENGINE_SECRET_KEY environment variables, representing your volcengine public key and private key respectively. VOLCENGINE_REGION is also used, if applicable:

```shell
provider "volcenginecc" {

}
```

Usage:

```shell
$ export VOLCENGINE_ACCESS_KEY="your_public_key"
$ export VOLCENGINE_SECRET_KEY="your_private_key"
$ export VOLCENGINE_REGION="cn-beijing"
```
